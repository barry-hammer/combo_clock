# combo_clock
Combining a digital clock with an analog clock. You can click the button to switch between the two clocks.

The original combo clock was created using the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki0XXrlKlHY. I then found a digital clock online. It took me a little while to properly get the button to work and to look correct, but I am pleased with the result. If you want to copy this clock, please let me know what changes you made.
